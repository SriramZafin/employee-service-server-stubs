# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled scalatra server.

This example uses the [scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:


To generate the server side stubs :

1. Make sure the swagger specification is available at https://<<app-name>>/api-docs/swagger.json
2. Download the swagger-codegen available at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen
3. Build the project using "mvn package"
4. From this project location. generate the server stubs using the below command

java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i https://<<app-name>>/api-docs/swagger.json  -l scalatra  -o ../scala-employee-service-server

where -l denotes the language for the reference implementation (Scalatra = Scala + Sinatra)
      -o denotes the output folder where the server stubs get generated
